# qucs-19-snap

This is a snap version of the [Frans Schreuder's PPA of QUCSi](
https://launchpad.net/~fransschreuder1/+archive/ubuntu/qucs),
corresponding to version 0.0.19-rc3, for Ubuntu 16.04.

The wrapper file was shamelessly copied from Eldar Khayrullin's 
[qucs-spice-snap](https://github.com/eldarkg/qucs-spice-snap)

[QUCS is a very nice circuit simulator](http://qucs.sourceforge.net/), which is also [found on github](https://github.com/Qucs).
